This is a fork of ValeevGroup/mpqc, 
for my undergrad research project at PPKU of Budapest.
I should advise against using this code for anything.

Contact me at my github account for any questions.

             The Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry Program
                                 MPQC 3.0 (alpha)

DESCRIPTION
===========

  MPQC computes the properties of molecules, ab initio, on a wide variety of
computer architectures.

  MPQC can compute production-quality spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted
Hartree-Fock energies and gradients, density functional theory energies and
gradients, second-order perturbation theory energies and gradients (closed-shell only).
MPQC also includes implementation of several advanced methods, such as
explicitly correlated coupled-cluster.

  MPQC runs on Linux and OS X standalone multicore platforms and distributed-memory
parallel machines.
